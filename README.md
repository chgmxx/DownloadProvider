DownloadProvider
================

a fork of https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/providers/DownloadProvider/+/android-4.4_r1.2

This fork has been refactored to build as a standard SDK application, pulling out references to internal libraries where necessary. 

*This is still a work in progress and will not likely build for you*
